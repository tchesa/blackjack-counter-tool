## üéÆ How to Use

### Card Counting System (Hi-Lo)

The Hi-Lo card counting system assigns values to cards:

- **Small cards (2-6)**: +1 to the count
- **Neutral cards (7-9)**: 0 (but tracked for true count calculation)
- **Large cards (10, J, Q, K, A)**: -1 to the count

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key     | Action   | Description                                     |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Q`     | +1 Count | Press when you see small cards (2-6)            |
| `W`     | Neutral  | Press when you see neutral cards (7-9)          |
| `E`     | -1 Count | Press when you see large cards (10, J, Q, K, A) |
| `R`     | Undo     | Undo the last counting action                   |
| `Space` | Reset    | Reset all counters (use when shoe is replaced)  |

### Getting Started

1. **Set the number of decks** in the shoe (typically 6 or 8 decks in casinos)
2. **Start counting** using the keyboard shortcuts as cards are revealed
3. **Track the true count** which divides the running count by remaining decks
4. **Reset when the shoe is replaced** to start a fresh count

## üéì Understanding True Count

The **true count** is calculated by dividing the running count by the number of decks remaining:

```
True Count = Running Count / Decks Remaining
```

This metric is more accurate than the running count because it accounts for how many cards are left in the shoe. A true count of +2 with one deck remaining is more advantageous than a true count of +2 with five decks remaining.
